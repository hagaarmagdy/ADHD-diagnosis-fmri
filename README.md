## ADHD-diagnosis-fmri

Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is one of the most common neurodevelopmental
disorders in children.

This research aims to propose different objective methods to accurately diagnose ADHD patients
by using magnetic resonance imaging data with spatio temporal deep learning models.

The proposed method will be to implement a hybrid 3D CNN LSTM model on fMRI scans
obtained from the ADHD 200 dataset.

Different models are also implemented such as Inception V3, AlexNet, and MLP on MRI scans
obtained from time points of the fMRI scans.
